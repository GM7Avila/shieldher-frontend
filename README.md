# ShieldHer - Landing Page | FuzzyLab

**ShieldHer** is a project under [FuzzyLab](https://fuzzylab.tech/), a scientific organization focused on developing innovative systems using Artificial Intelligence (AI). The goal of ShieldHer is to provide support, resources, and raise awareness about online harassment and misogyny. This landing page represents the main home interface, showcasing the project's identity and purpose.

It was developed by me as part of my work as a frontend developer, focusing on creating the main landing page as well as other internal screens of the system. The development was done using React + TypeScript and Material UI.
